</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> people have the impression that to enjoy
country sights and sounds, and all the peaceful
rural beauties and bright hues of an English
landscape, one must go a long way out of London.
Mr Richard Jefferies, in his recent volume, <i>Nature
near London</i> (Chatto and Windus), has, with his
admirable power of nature-painting, shown this
to be a mistake. About twelve miles from the
great metropolis there are to be found small
picturesque villages lying in the heart of leafy
copses, and rural lanes imbedded in greenery,
and filled with bird and insect life. Here the
wayfarer, weary with the dust and smoke of
London, may inhale an atmosphere laden with
resinous and balmy scents, and stretch himself
in the cool grass beside streams beloved by the
angler, where patches of forget-me-nots gem the
greensward with their soft turquoise-blue, and the
yellow flag hangs out in the bright summer sunshine
its gay streamers of gold.</p>

<p>Mr Jefferies tells us regarding one of these
tiny brooks, that he watched season after
season a large trout that lay in a deep pool
under the shadow of a great beech-tree. For
nearly four years, in shadow and sunshine,
he observed this veteran of the finny tribe as
he lay meditatively watching the world outside
from the quiet depths of his snug pool. The
noisy little sedge-birds chattered overhead, and
the patient anglers cast their lines with crafty care
by the side of the brook; but no bait they could
use had any charm for him. At length, by slow
degrees, there came to be a comparative friendliness
and confidence between the trout and the
patient watcher who stood so still and silent
by the edge of the pool. Sometimes the trout
would venture out of the shadow, and raising
himself over a dead branch that lay in the water,
display all his speckled beauties in the ripple
and sunshine. At last, one bright summer
morning, an end came to this quaint friendship.
An awful revolution occurred in the quiet life of
the brook—the water was dammed up and let off
by a side-hatch, in order that some large pipe
might be laid down; and the big trout, with his
lesser brethren, fell a victim to the predatory instincts
of a party of navvies. Our author looked
in vain next day into the still depths of the beech-tree
pool; his finny friend was gone, and the
place looked empty and dull without him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe to any one who has
not experienced it for himself, how much the
near neighbourhood of London enhances all the
beauties of the country, and brings out the sweet
scents of the fields and hedges. In the cool
dewy mornings, the honeysuckle trailing along
the hedgerows perfumes the air all around, and
mingles with the delicious scent of the bean and
hay fields. In these woodland copses, nature has
opened her flowery cornucopia and poured out her
treasures with a liberal hand. Here one stumbles
upon a clump of wild-roses, with their delicate
pink glow and faint sweet perfume; there, a
few steps farther bring you to a lime-tree laden
with blossoms, and you feel the whole perfumed
air heavy with the slumberous hum of the bees
busy overhead. Rabbits dart out and in from
under the green palm-like fronds of a great
clump of brake-fern; the woodpeckers call to
each other; the jays screech from the leafy lanes;
wood-pigeons coo from the depths of the copse-wood.
There is no blank of silence, no absence
of the companionship of living things, no lack
of vivid interest for any one who can scan with
an intelligent eye the pages of nature’s great
book.</p>

<p>Away over the rippling hayfields, the lark,
mounting upwards, a tiny speck in the cloudless
blue of the summer sky, makes the air quiver
with the glad thrilling notes of his morning song;
and down in the leafy hollow of the copse, where
the brook murmurs gently beneath the overhanging
boughs, the blackbird trills his mellifluous
flute-like notes. Birds, our author says, abound.
‘In some places, almost every clod has its lark,
every bush its songster.’</p>

<p>One particular lane, with a high hedge bordered
with elm-trees, had four or five nightingales; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">{226}</span>
a copse near it resounded in the season with the
cheerful call of the cuckoo. Magpies, which have
become scarce in many places throughout the
country, are plentiful near London, where some
birds are also found which, in many country
districts, are but rare and occasional visitors, such
as the blackcap, shrike, and gorgeous kingfisher.
To a student of bird-life, such spots as a little
wood, which our author christened Nightingale
Copse, cannot fail to prove a perfect paradise.
It was a favourite resort not only of nightingales,
but of other migratory birds—chiff-chaffs,
willow wrens, golden-crested wrens, fieldfares,
&amp;c. In the fields bordering the highway,
partridges abounded; and Mr Jefferies counted
on one occasion as many as seventeen young
pheasants all feeding together on the wheat-stubbles.
Nor is the ear the only sense which
is charmed in these woodland copses—in the
hedgerows, and under the straggling trees and
bushes which border the woods, flowers abound,
gleaming out in the sunshine from between the
tall grasses with a sudden surprise of vivid colour;
or spreading like enamel over the short turf; or
intertwining their gay garlands with the clustering
masses of creeping bramble. Each flower has
its own peculiar habitat, where it flourishes luxuriantly.
There are patches of the yellow rock
rose, of the cranesbill, of the sweet purple wild
thyme, of the starry white stitchwort, of the
campion and yellow snapdragon; while stately
and tall under the shadow of the birch-trees, the
foxglove hangs out to the rustling breeze its lovely
bells of clouded purple. Nor is heath awanting;
‘the open slopes beyond Sandown are covered
with heath, growing so thickly, that even the
narrow footpaths are hidden by the overhanging
bushes of it. Beneath and amid the heath, what
seems a species of lichen grows so profusely as to
give a gray undertone to the whole.’</p>

<p>In autumn, this stretch of heath blazes out into
a deep glory of purple, so rich and full, that it
seems to give the very atmosphere a glow of
purple light. Beyond the heath, there are fir-woods,
stretching to the east and west; while
southwards, the heath melts into the soft green
of corn and meadow lands, with scattered clumps
of trees. The open slopes among the straggling
firs, which dot like sentinels the borders of these
pine-woods, are covered with forests of tail ferns,
amid which the browsing cows are lost to sight,
and only reveal their whereabouts by the tinkling
music of the small bells suspended to their
necks.</p>

<p>Adders are common in these woods, and are
sometimes killed for the sake of their oil, which
some folks consider a specific for deafness. It is
procured by skinning the adder and taking the
fat and boiling it; the result being a clear oil,
which never thickens even in the coldest weather.
It is applied by pouring a small quantity into the
ear, exactly in the same manner as the poison was
poured into the ear of the sleeping king in <i>Hamlet</i>.
Squirrels abound in these copses, and so do weasels
and stoats.</p>

<p>In some fields christened by our author Magpie
Fields, because he one day saw ten magpies all
together in one of them, herbs abound which are
in request among herbalists for medicinal purposes.
One of these is yarrow. One day, looking
at some mowers at work in a hayfield, he saw a
man in advance of the others pulling up the
yarrow plants as fast as he could and carefully
laying them aside. Asking him why he did so,
he answered, that although it seemed such a
common weed, it was not without its value, for
that a person sometimes came and took away a
whole trap-load of it. The flowers were boiled,
and mixed with cayenne pepper, and were then
used as a remedy for colds in the chest. Dandelions
are also in request; the tender leaves are
pulled in the spring, and taken away in sackfuls
to be eaten as salad. There are also hellebore
and blue scabious; and the rough-leaved comfrey;
and borage with its reminiscences of claret-cup;
and groundsel, dear to the owners of pet
birds; and knotted figwort, and Aaron’s rod;
and a whole tribe of strongly scented mints and
peppermints. The belief in these simples, which
made the reputation in the middle ages of many
a wonder-working doctor and village witch, is
fast dying out in the country districts, where
the agricultural labourers scarcely know one
herb from another; but it flourishes still around
the mighty and enlightened metropolis. The
herb self-heal is to be found in many hedgerows
of many harvest-fields, as well as on the stubbles
near London; but very few reapers now would
know it if they saw it, or ever think of applying
it to any accidental cut or gash.</p>

<p>In the harvest and turnip-hoeing seasons,
picturesque bivouac fires dot the fields and lanes.
These do not owe their existence to parties of
pleasure-seekers, who go a-gipsying under the
greenwood tree, but are rather the outcome of a
hard struggle for the means of subsistence. They
belong to wandering Irish labourers, who move
about from farm to farm wherever they can get
work, sleeping in barns or outhouses, and in fine
weather doing their cooking in the open air.
Nothing can be more unlike the populace of the
vast adjacent metropolis than these agricultural
labourers, native or imported. Look at the
ploughman in the furrows yonder, with his stolid
characterless face, vacantly regarding the team of
three stately horses before him. Intent day by
day on the earth beneath his feet, he sees, or at
least notices little else. ‘His mind imbibes the
spirit of the soil,’ and cannot rise beyond. When
the plough stops, he takes out his bread and
cheese; and as he munches away, his eyes fall on
the sunbeams glittering on the roof of the Crystal
Palace; but the sparkling reflection awakens no
train of thought in his uncontemplative soul; he
takes no interest except in the furrows at his feet;
although near London, he is not of it.</p>

<p>In the collection of English pottery in the
Museum is preserved the simple rustic memory
of these tillers of the soil, the men who, centuries
ago, ploughed like this simple countryman these
beautiful English acres, scattering the seed over
the furrows in the green flush of spring, and
garnering the golden grain beneath the mellow
skies of autumn. It is curious that so much of
the unwritten history of our race should be
preserved by so frail a thing as earthenware.
These jugs and mugs, with their quaint mottoes
and ornamentation, carry the spectator back to
the sports and habits of a bygone age.</p>

<p>‘May the best cock win,’ recalls a brutal sport
now almost unknown. The frog at the bottom
of the jug is a rebuke to the too greedy toper;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">{227}</span>
while the motto on another cup shows that there
were grumblers even in the good old days, and
that times were hard then as well as now:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wishing these hard times to mend.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beyond the woodlands and valleys which Mr
Jefferies has described so happily, are the vast
South Downs, hidden in masses of gray mist.
These wide sheep-walks are seemingly endless in
their extent. They are profusely covered with
flowers in their season, with patches of furze, and
with short thick grass, amid which the wild
thyme luxuriates, spreading out into soft cushions
of purple which might make a seat for a king,
and permeating with its aromatic fragrance the
whole keen air of the uplands. The furze is full
of bird-life. Only game has decreased with the
increase of cultivation; and with the decrease
of game, foxes have become fewer. A few years
ago, they were so abundant, that a shepherd told
our author that he had sometimes seen as many
as six at a time sunning themselves on the
precipitous face of the cliffs at Beachy Head.
They ascend and descend the precipice by narrow
winding-paths of their own with the greatest
ease and in perfect safety, unless a couple have
a quarrel on one of the narrow rock-ledges, when
fatal results often ensue—one or both toppling
over.</p>

<p>‘Lands of gold,’ says our author, ‘have been
found, and lands of spices and precious merchandise;
but the South Downs are the land of
health. There is always the delicious air, turn
where you will; and the grass, the very touch
of which refreshes.’ Besides all this, there is the
peculiar beauty which gives its chief charm to
all elevated situations, the interest of the panorama
which spreads around and beneath—the distant
trees which wave in the freshening breeze; the
gleam of light which brings out into strong relief
the warm bit of colouring supplied by the tiled
roof of yonder farmhouse; the flashes of sunshine
which brighten up the gloom, and chase the
shadows across the swelling uplands and green
low-lying meadows beyond.</p>

<p>Seen in the shifting lights and glooms of a
breezy autumn day, this lofty, lonely spot seems
a land of enchanted beauty, which holds the
spectator spellbound, till masses of cloud, rolling
up from the sea, throw deep purple shadows over
the peaceful landscape, and warn him that darkness
is about to fall over the flower-spangled
slopes and gleaming sea beyond.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.—CHANGES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of a stranger in Kingshope was not
such an unusual occurrence as to attract much
particular attention. The villagers were accustomed
in the summer to frequent visits of bands
of ‘beanfeasters’ or ‘wayzegoose’ parties, as the
annual outings of the employees of large city
firms are called. On these occasions there were
athletic games on the common, pleasant roamings
through the Forest, and high revel in the <i>King’s
Head</i> or the <i>Cherry Tree</i> afterwards. Then there
were itinerant photographers, negro minstrels, and
gypsy cheap Jacks, with caravans drawn by animals
which may be best described as the skeletons of
horses in skin-tights—working the Forest ‘pitch’
or ‘lay’—these being the slang terms for any
given scene of operation for the professional
vagrant. The bird-snarers and the pigeon-flyers
seemed to be always about. In the hunting
season there were generally a few guests at the
<i>King’s Head</i>; and so, although every new visitor
underwent a bovine stare, he was forgotten as
soon as he passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr Beecham’s ways were so quiet, that before
he had been a week in the place, he had glided
so imperceptibly into its ordinary life that he
seemed to be as much a part of it as the parson
and the doctor. His presence was of course
observed, but there was little sign of impertinent
curiosity. It was understood that he was looking
about the district for a suitable house in which
to settle, or for a site on which to build one.
This accounted for his long walks; and there
was nothing remarkable in the fact that his
peregrinations led him frequently by Willowmere,
and sometimes into the neighbourhood of Ringsford
Manor.</p>

<p>Although his ways were so quiet, there was
nothing reserved or mysterious about them. The
object which had brought him to Kingshope was
easily comprehended; he entered into conversation
with the people he met, and took an interest
in the affairs of the place—the crops, the weather,
and the prospects of the poor during the coming
winter. Yet nothing more was known of his
antecedents than that he came from London,
and that he visited the city two or three times
a week. He dressed plainly; he lived moderately
at the inn—not like one who required to reckon
his expenses carefully, but like one whose tastes
were simple and easily satisfied.</p>

<p>The general belief was that he had belonged
to one of the professions, and that he had retired
on a moderate competence, in order to devote his
time to study of some sort. He himself said
nothing on the subject.</p>

<p>One of the first acquaintances he made was
Uncle Dick, who adhered to the kindly old
country custom of giving the time of day to
any one he met in the lanes or saw passing his
gates. The first salutation of the master of
Willowmere induced Mr Beecham to make inquiries
about the district, which led to future
conversations. These would have speedily introduced
the stranger to the farmhouse and its
mistress; but hitherto he had not availed himself
of the cordial invitation which was given
him. He was apparently satisfied with the privilege
of going over the land with Uncle Dick,
inspecting his stock and admiring his horses, and
thus speedily developing a casual acquaintanceship
into a friendship. On these occasions he
had opportunities of seeing and conversing with
Madge, and she formed as favourable an opinion
of him as her uncle had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">{228}</span></p>

<p>‘Has he ever said what made him think of
coming to settle hereabout?’ inquired the dame
one day, after listening to their praises of the
stranger.</p>

<p>‘Never thought of asking him,’ replied Crawshay,
wondering if there was anything wrong
in having neglected to put such a natural question.</p>

<p>‘He mentioned that some friends of his lived
near here at one time,’ said Madge, ‘and that he
had always liked the Forest.’</p>

<p>‘Has he spoken about any family? Is he
married? Has he any children?’</p>

<p>‘Why, mother, you wouldn’t have me go prying
into what doesn’t concern us!’ was Crawshay’s
exclamation. ‘It does seem a bit queer, though,
that he seems to have nobody belonging to
him.’</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy thought it very queer; and when
Philip came next, she asked him to describe Mr
Shield to her again.</p>

<p>‘He must have changed very much since I
last saw him,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘I scarcely
know what put it into my head, but this Mr
Beecham is much more like what I should have
fancied your uncle would grow into, than the
gentleman you describe. But foreign parts do
seem to alter people strangely. There was neighbour
Hartopp’s lad went away to California; and
when he came back ten years after, it took his
own mother two whole days before she would
believe that he was himself. Yes, foreign parts
do alter people strangely in appearances as well
as feelings.’</p>

<p>It was regarded by the little group as a good
joke that Aunt Hessy should have formed the
romantic suspicion that the stranger in the village
might be her old friend Austin Shield. They
did not know anything of the confidential letter.
She had said nothing about it yet, and her conscience
was much troubled on that account.</p>

<p>‘It’s wrong to keep a secret from Dick,’ she
kept saying to herself. ‘I know it is wrong, and
I am doing it. If harm come of it, I shall never
forgive myself; I hope others may be able to
do it.’</p>

<p>She regarded with something like fear the
enthusiasm with which Philip spoke of the social
revolution he was to effect by means of the wealth
placed at his command. Yet it was a noble object
the youth was aiming at. Surely wealth could do
no harm, when it was used for the purpose of
making the miserable happy, of showing men
how they might prosper, and teaching them the
great lesson, that content and comfort were only
to be found in hard work. The scheme looked
so feasible to her, and was so good, that she
remained silent lest she should mar the work.
She bore the stings of conscience, and prayed
that Philip might pass safely through the ordeal
to which he was unconsciously being subjected.
He talked of the bounty of his uncle, and she was
uneasy, knowing that this bounty might prove
his ruin, although she was quite unable to see how
that could come about as matters looked at present.
She was simply afraid, and began to understand
why preachers often spoke of gold as a fiend—the
more dangerous because it appeared as the
agent of good. Then there was the coming of this
stranger at the same time that Philip met his
uncle in London. Of course there was nothing
to associate the two in her mind except the period
of their arrival. But she was puzzled.</p>

<p>‘There is not the slightest resemblance between
the two men, I assure you,’ Philip said; ‘but
there is this strong resemblance between my uncle
as he is now and as he was, by your own account,
when you knew him long ago—he is as odd in
his ways as ever. He will not discuss anything
with me except by letter. That, you might say,
was no more than prudent, as it can leave no
room for dispute as to what we say to each
other.’</p>

<p>‘He wants to make you careful,’ said the dame,
with some feeling of relief; for this arrangement
seemed to prove that he was desirous of helping
Philip to pass the test.</p>

<p>‘But, besides, he will scarcely see me at all;
and when he does, he is as short with me and
in as great a hurry to get rid of me as he was
on the first day I called on him. When I try
to explain things to him, he says: “All right; go
your own way. If you want me to consider
anything, you must write it out for me.” I don’t
mind it now, having got used to it; but sometimes
I cannot help wondering’——</p>

<p>Philip checked himself, as if he had been about
to say something which he suddenly remembered
should not be spoken even to his dearest
friends.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ queried Uncle Dick, looking at him
along the line of his churchwarden pipe as if it
were a gun and he were taking aim. ‘What are
you stopping for? You can’t help wondering
at what?’</p>

<p>‘Only at his droll ways,’ answered Philip. ‘I
should have thought that risking so much money
in my hand, he would have been anxious to have
the fullest particulars of all that I was doing
with it.’</p>

<p>‘So should I, lad. What does your father say
about it?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing more than that he will want to speak
to me one day soon. He is not pleased.’</p>

<p>‘There don’t seem to me much to be not pleased
about.—Eh, mother?’</p>

<p>‘We’ll see after a bit,’ answered the dame,
cautiously, but smiling. ‘We don’t know yet
whether Philip is to prove himself a very wise
man or’——</p>

<p>‘Or a fool,’ interrupted Crawshay, with one of
his hearty laughs.</p>

<p>‘Nay, Dick; not that. Philip will never prove
himself a fool; but he might do worse—he might
prove himself a sensible man doing foolish
things.’</p>

<p>The stranger who provoked this discussion went
on in his calm way, seeking what apparently he
could not find, but always with a pleasant smile
or a kindly ‘good-day’ to the people he met in
the fields and lanes.</p>

<p>One of his favourite halting-places was at the
stile which gave access from the roadway to the
Willowmere meadows. On the opposite side of
the road were the willows and beeches, bordering
the river. Four of the latter trees were known
as the ‘dancing beeches,’ from the position in
which they stood, as if they had suddenly halted
whilst whirling round in a country-dance; and
when the wind blew, their branches interlaced
and creaked in unison, as if they wanted to begin
the dance again. This was a famous trysting-place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">{229}</span>
and in the summer-time the swains and
their maidens would ‘wander in the meadows
where the May-flowers grow.’ This is the burden
of a rustic ballad which you would often hear
chanted in the quiet evenings. It served the
double purpose of supplying the place of conversation
and of agreeably expressing the thoughts
of the singers. Uncle Dick sometimes saw and
heard them; but with kindly indifference to his
clover, he would shake his head and turn
away, remembering that he, too, had once been
young.</p>

<p>Mr Beecham resting on the stile could, by an
easy movement of the head, command nearly the
whole of the hollow in which the village lay; and
looking upward, could catch glimpses of Willowmere
House peering through the apple and pear
trees of the orchard.</p>

<p>After the lapse of years, how new it all looks,
and yet how old; how changed, and yet familiar.
There is the church, the same gray weather-beaten
pile, in spite of the vicar’s manful efforts to get it
put into a state of thorough repair. The vicar
himself is the same cheery good friend in gladness,
and the sympathising comforter in sorrow; his
hair is almost gray now, and his figure is inclined
to be rotund; but he is still the same. There are,
however, new gravestones in the churchyard,
and they bear the names of old friends. Their
places in the world have been easily filled
up; their places in the memory of the survivors
never can be. Ay, there is change indeed.</p>

<p>But here is the golden autumn, its lustre slowly
growing dim under the touch of approaching
winter; there are the green fields and the red
ploughed lands—they are just as they looked
long ago, although his eyes see them through the
sad haze which separates him from the past.
There are the sounds of the cattle, the ripple of
the river, and the rustle of the trees—sounds to
which he gave no particular heed in the old time,
and now they are like the voices of welcoming
friends.</p>

<p>So the present steps by us; pain and sorrow
plant milestones on our way; by-and-by the eye
glances tenderly backward and over them, and in
old age we hear the voices of our youth.</p>

<p>‘Good-afternoon, Mr Beecham. Do you think
it will rain?’</p>

<p>He lifted his head, and bowed to Madge and
Philip as they were about to pass over the stile.
He looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid it will rain; but you will be
home before it begins, I think.’</p>

<p>Philip gave her his hand; she mounted the
three foot-worn wooden steps and descended on
the meadow side.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will always have a strong hand
to help you over the stiles, Miss Heathcote,’ he
said, smiling; but there seemed to be as much
of earnest as of jest in his meaning.</p>

<p>‘I believe she may fairly count upon that, Mr
Beecham,’ answered Philip.</p>

<p>‘The pity is, we so seldom find what we count
upon,’ said Mr Beecham, shaking his head.</p>

<p>‘Then we must make the best of what we do
find,’ replied Philip cheerfully, ‘and scramble over
somehow without a helping hand.’</p>

<p>The two passed on at a smart pace up the
meadow, Mr Beecham looking after them with
a dream in his eyes.</p>

<p>Overhead, on this afternoon, was a sky gloomy
and threatening; but on the horizon were rivers
of pale golden light, giving hope and courage to
the weary ones who were like to faint by the
wayside. Suddenly a white light relieved the
gloom immediately above, and the golden rivers
were lashed with dark promontories; but still,
the farthest point was light. Again suddenly a
white glory burst through the gloom, dazzling
the eyes and breaking the clouds into fantastic
shapes, which fled from it like the witches of evil
fleeing before the majestic genii of good. Another
change, and all gradually toned down into the
soft repose of a calm evening, bearing the promise
of a pleasant day to follow.</p>

<p>‘I have lived alone too much,’ muttered Mr
Beecham with a long-drawn breath, which is the
only approach to a sigh ventured upon by a man
past middle age; ‘and my own morbid broodings
make me superstitious, showing me symbols in
everything. I hope this one may turn out well,
however.’</p>

<p>Philip and Madge had disappeared by this
time, and Mr Beecham walked slowly on to the
village.</p>

<p>When the young people reached the homestead,
Madge announced that Philip had come to tell
them something very important, which he had
refused to reveal until they should be in the
house.</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy glanced uneasily from one to the
other; but seeing no sign of disturbance on either
face, her uneasiness passed away. She concluded
that it was some jest with which Philip had been
teasing Madge.</p>

<p>‘I have seen Mr Shield again to-day,’ he
began, ‘and I have received new instructions
from him.’</p>

<p>‘He is not going to send you off to Griqualand,
after all?’ queried Madge quickly.</p>

<p>‘O no; but maybe you would prefer that
he should order me off there, rather than tell
me to take chambers in town.’</p>

<p>‘Chambers in town! What can that be for?’</p>

<p>‘Well, he was as short and bustling as ever;
he never seems to have time to discuss anything.
“That’s what I want,” he says; “if you
don’t like it, write, and tell me why.” All he
said about it was that he desired me to feel
independent.’</p>

<p>The uneasy expression reappeared on Aunt
Hessy’s face.</p>

<p>‘Have you consented to make this change?’ she
asked quietly.</p>

<p>‘I could see no objection; and in several ways
the arrangement will be convenient. I made it
clear that it was not in any way to be considered
as a step towards separating me from my family.
He said I could please myself as regarded my
family—he had nothing to do with that.... Do
you not like it, Madge?’</p>

<p>The clear eyes looked wistfully in his face.
‘No, Philip; I do not like it. But perhaps Mr
Shield is right; and it may be as well that you
should have the experience of being away from
us for a time at least.’</p>

<p>‘Living away from you! Why I shall be here
as often as ever!’</p>

<p>She said nothing; and Aunt Hessy put the
apparently irrelevant question:</p>

<p>‘Have you seen Mr Beecham to-day, Madge?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">{230}</span></p>

<p>‘We saw him by the stile at the foot of the
meadow as we passed.’</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy, with evident disappointment,
abandoned the droll fancy which had for a time
possessed her mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_QUEER_DISHES">SOME QUEER DISHES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, in England, a man was pushed to discover
a new animal food, it would, I think, be a long
time before he hit upon bats as at all likely to
furnish him with a desirable addition to his table,
even if their diminutive size did not place an
insuperable obstacle in the way of their being so
utilised. But in many of the South Sea Islands
where the flying-fox—a species of bat, fifteen inches
or so across the wings—is common, it is used
as food by the natives, and its flesh is by no means
to be despised even by epicures. This animal,
frugivorous in his tastes as a rule, does not for
all that turn up his nose at a plump moth or
a succulent beetle when they chance to come
in his way; but he usually confines himself to
fruit—ripe bananas of the best quality and plenty
of them being about his mark; and dreadful
havoc he and his friends would make in the
banana gardens, if the natives—well aware of
his habits—did not hasten to bind quantities of
dead leaves round the ripening fruit, and so
preserve it from his attacks. It would seem
absurd to a stranger to the country to be informed
that such an insignificant animal as a bat could
seriously threaten the fruit-harvest in countries
where it is so abundant; but he would change
his opinion when informed that the flying-foxes
often settle in hundreds in any likely plantation;
and as they always destroy very much more than
they consume, the loss and inconvenience they
cause to the natives may be properly estimated.</p>

<p>The bat in question is not so strictly nocturnal
in his habits as his English brother; and although
he usually sallies out at sunset, yet I have often
noticed them sailing about in broad daylight,
provided the weather was dull and overcast; the
flight is even and regular, very like that of a
rook, and not in the least resembling the extremely
erratic mode of progression affected by our native
species. If in their manner of flying—a few
steady flaps and then a long sail—they remind
one of the rook, they also resemble our old friend
in their habit of assembling together at bedtime,
when they all retire to roost on the same grove
of trees, and hang head downwards with their
wings wrapped round their bodies, looking like
a collection of large cobwebs.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the
meeting and subsequent proceedings take place
in silence; the contrary is the case; and an
immense amount of chattering is carried on for
a considerable time, when no doubt all the affairs
of the day are duly discussed, as well as other
matters amatory and otherwise. In the old
heathen times, the rookeries were strongly tabooed
by the priests; and even to the present day, the
natives, more especially the old men, have an
evident aversion to interfere with the sacred trees,
a feeling which does not in the least prevent them
from killing all the bats they can in other places.</p>

<p>The natives prepare them for food by first
cutting off the wings and then passing the body
through the fire, to remove the fur, and with
it the strong foxy smell with which it is impregnated.
It is then carefully scraped, split
open, and afterwards grilled on the coals spitchcock
fashion, when it is ready for consumption;
and is capital eating, having a rich gamy flavour
something between a hare and a woodcock.</p>

<p>I was so much encouraged by the success of
my first essay at bat-eating, that I afterwards
had a pie made of several I had shot, and from
my previous experience, rather looked forward
to a good dinner; but when the pastry was cut
open, I was grievously disappointed by finding
that the fetid odour peculiar to the live animal
had survived the cooking—from being unable to
escape from the pastry—rendering it utterly uneatable,
and so for the future contented myself with
bat <i>au naturel</i>—that is, native fashion.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned animal is very common in
Australia, and is quite as great a nuisance among
the orchards there as he is in the islands; but
it will be some considerable time, I fancy, before
our colonial brothers utilise him in the kitchen.</p>

<p>I don’t suppose that many people—at least
English people, who are tolerably prejudiced in
their way—have ever voluntarily gone in for a
cuttle-fish or octopus diet, as they are horribly
weird, uncanny animals to look at; and few, I
opine, would feel inclined to make a ‘square
meal’ off the shiny creatures, at least until
other more prepossessing kinds of food remained
to be tried. Nevertheless, throughout the whole
of the Pacific, including Japan, all the different
varieties of cuttle and octopus are regarded as a
<i>bonne bouche</i> of peculiar excellence; and both in
its capture and preparation, the natives display
considerable ingenuity. I remember once, when
sailing in the tropics, seeing one morning the
deck of our little schooner nearly covered with
that very elegant little cuttle-fish called the
‘flying-squid.’ The sea had been very rough
during the night, and I could never properly
ascertain whether the squid had come on board
of their own accord, attracted by the light—as
the men affirmed—or had been left there by a
heavy sea we had shipped just before daylight.
Anyway, our cook, a smart Maltese, at once set
to work to collect them, and then, much to the
disgust of the sailors, who are the most prejudiced
of mortals, he forthwith proceeded to cook them
for the cabin table, and sent us down dishes of
squid both curried and fried that were much
approved of by all who partook of them; and
proved a delightful change after the long course
of ‘salt junk’ and tinned soup and bouillie that
the slow sailing of our little craft had obliged us
to adopt.</p>

<p>These fish were about six inches long, had
large brilliant eyes of a set expression, and were
furnished with a pair of flippers or wings. They
also—unlike any other kind of fish that I am
acquainted with—rejoice in a couple of tails,
in lieu of the orthodox number. The body,
almost transparent, was of a delicate olive brown.
Altogether, they were pretty little things, and
tasted even better than they looked.</p>

<p>I am now about to introduce my readers to a
dish of octopus prepared <i>secundum artem</i> by a
South Sea native. The octopus is by no means,
without proper apparatus, an easy animal to
lay hold of; on the contrary, it demands all the
cunning of the most experienced South Sea fisherman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">{231}</span>
to wile him from his haunts in the coral
and to secure a good number for a feast.</p>

<p>But here is my Tongese friend Fakatene, just
about to launch his <i>hamatefna</i>, or fishing-canoe;
and we cannot do better than accompany him on
his trip, and lend a hand in catching the fish we
are to partake of. But first, just notice how
ingeniously his tiny vessel is constructed out of
timber of the bread-fruit tree. This tree does
not, so far south—we are in about twenty-three
degrees five minutes south—attain to any great
size, and the timber, therefore, is proportionately
small and scarce, which accounts for the small
size of the pieces used. The hull, you notice, is
pretty well in one piece, except that queer-shaped
bit so artfully let in near the bows, and so close-fitting
all round that even a penknife could not
be introduced between the seams; and were it
not for the difference in the grain of the wood,
the ingenious patch would never be detected.
The top sides are formed of several small planks
neatly sewn on to the hull with sinnet, and
joined in the same manner to one another; and
yet, with all this patching, she exceeds in beauty,
in the grace of her lines, and in her extreme
buoyancy in the water, the finest four-oar ever
turned out by Searle in his most palmy days.</p>

<p>Fakatene is pleased with our admiration of his
highly prized canoe, and takes some pains to
explain that she was moulded on the lines of the
bonito, one of the swiftest of fishes. Not such
a bad idea that, we consider, for a poor native;
but one that we intellectual white men are much
too proud, not to say too conceited, to follow;
so we go in for all kinds of scientific curves
and angles, with the result that our builders are
constantly producing craft that will neither pull
nor sail, and that would have been a disgrace
to Noah himself, or even to prehistoric man.—But
to return to our canoe. She is provided
with an outrigger called a ‘thama,’ to prevent
capsizing; with a carved-wood bailer, in case we
ship a sea or make any water from the working
of the seams; also with a long three-pronged
fish-spear, a few lines, a bamboo of fresh water;
and last, but not least, with the inevitable fire-stick,
or smouldering twist of tapa cloth, to
furnish a light for our friend’s <i>seluka</i> (cigarette).
Off at last; and Fakatene, who poled swiftly over
the shallow part of the reef, has taken to his
paddle, and coasting along the island for some
distance, we soon come to a favourable spot for
our purpose; so we drop anchor—a large stone—and
business commences.</p>

<p>The octopus dwells in holes in the reef, keeping
only a portion of his body exposed, so that,
while he can look out for his prey, he can at the
same time quickly withdraw within his hole,
directly his dread enemy the shark appears, who
is always foraging about the reefs in search of
adventurous cuttles.</p>

<p>Now, I must tell you that the octopus, although
partial enough to crabs, is particularly fond of
the inhabitant of the spotted cowrie or ear-shell,
so common in our shops; and so Fakatene, well
aware of this fact, has prepared a cunning bait,
artfully constructed of a number of small plates
of the shell fastened together in such a manner
that while similar in appearance to the real thing,
yet, being much heavier, and not containing any
air, sinks at once, which a real shell would not
do. Our friend now lowers his line, with the
shell-bait attached, until it touches the bottom,
and then raising it a few inches off the ground,
jerks it gently up and down. Presently, a pull
on the line shows that the fish has taken the
bait; more jerking on the part of the native;
which the octopus replies to by at once throwing
out a fresh arm. The jerking still continues; until
the fish, dreading the escape of his prey, lets go
his hold of the rocks, and wraps the whole of
his body round the shell; when the native, perceiving
that his line is no longer fast to the
ground, gently hauls up the line, and finally
deposits an immense octopus in the bottom of
the canoe. Our new friend no sooner finds
himself caught, than he lets go the deceptive
bait, and with his great goggle eyes staring hard
at nothing in particular, sprawls about in the
most awkward fashion, at the same time giving
vent to a species of grunt, until at last he finally
retires into the darkest corner he can find, and
collapses into a lump of grayish-looking jelly,
about a third part of his apparent size when
in motion.</p>

<p>Having by the same means secured several
more fish, we return to land, when the canoe is
duly housed, and Fakatene disposes of the octopi
by turning them inside out and hanging them
up to dry in the sun, having first carefully saved
all the sepia left in the fish, as this is esteemed
a great luxury, and an indispensable ingredient
in preparing the sauce.</p>

<p>When the cuttle is to be cooked, it is first of
all carefully cleaned and scraped, when all the
outer skin, including the hideous-looking suckers,
comes off. The fish is then cut in pieces, and
having been tied up in a banana-leaf, is baked
in an oven for a considerable time in conjunction
with cocoa-nut milk and a certain proportion of
the inky-hued sepia above mentioned, and which,
as is well known, is made use of by the fish when
alive to obscure the water when escaping from
the pursuit of its enemies. It takes some time
to cook octopus properly, as it is naturally tough
and stringy; but when well prepared, it is one
of the most delicate and luscious dishes I ever
tasted; and, singular to say, the cooking converts
the tripy, stringy-looking substance into a solid
meaty food, bearing a curious resemblance to
lobster both in taste and colour, only rather
firmer in texture; a most unlooked-for occurrence
in such dissimilar articles.</p>

<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN THREE CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I got back to town, the sessions were only
a week off; so the first thing I did was to call
on the solicitor in charge of my murder case, in
order to learn from him how it stood, and to take
it off his hands. The magistrate, of course, had
sent the prisoner for trial. When I came to read
the depositions, the case against him seemed perfectly
simple, and as conclusive as circumstantial
evidence could make it. The crime had not
occurred so long ago but that a diligent search
had unearthed several witnesses. The servant-girl,
who had now become the wife of a dairyman
in the immediate neighbourhood, was
found. She proved the bad conduct of young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">{232}</span>
Harden, and the ill-will which gradually grew
up between him and her former mistress. She
also spoke to his ejectment from the house on
the day of the murder, and to his threats at
the street-door. She swore to the knife, which
had been in the possession of the police ever
since, as having belonged to the prisoner.
There were other witnesses to the same facts;
and the landlord, my client, and several others,
proved the flourishing of the identical knife and
the ominous words in the public-house. To complete
the chain, the man who had instructed me
proved the finding of the knife in the room where
the murder was committed; and two or three
witnesses remembered being by his side and seeing
him stoop down and pick it up. These, with the
final facts of his sudden disappearance and changes
of name, appeared both to me and to my friend
to be capable of being spun into a rope quite
strong enough to swing John Harden out of the
world.</p>

<p>‘But,’ said my solicitor-friend, ‘the queerest
thing of all is that no one is going to appear for
the prisoner.’</p>

<p>‘No one to appear for him?’</p>

<p>‘No one. Young Elkin holds a watching brief
on behalf of the prisoner’s master, and that is
all. He said Harden had been in Mr Slocum’s—that’s
his master—service for over seven years,
behaving extremely well all the time. He was
invaluable to his old master, who is something
of an invalid. He had turned religious, and
was disgusted at his former wicked life.’</p>

<p>‘But I suppose he has money—or, at anyrate,
if Slocum is so fond of him, why doesn’t he pay
for the defence?’</p>

<p>‘Why, it seems that his notion of religion
forbids Harden to avail himself of worldly arts.
Slocum is only too anxious to retain some one;
but Harden won’t have it, and no one can persuade
him. Says he is in the hands of a Higher
Power, and it shall be given him what he
shall speak, and all the rest of it. He wanted
to make a speech to the magistrate; but Slocum,
by Elkin’s advice, did manage to induce him to
hold his tongue for the present, and say he would
reserve his defence. Of course they hope he will
come to his senses before the trial. But I don’t
know how that will be. I never saw such an
obstinate pig. Only gave in to his master about
not speaking because the poor man began to
whimper in court!’</p>

<p>The main part of my work had been done
for me, and it only remained to bespeak copies
of the depositions, see the witnesses, and make
sure that they intended to say at the Old Bailey
substantially the same things as they had said at
the police court—a most necessary precaution, the
imagination being so vivid in people of this class
that they are very likely to amplify their tale if
possible—and prepare the brief for the prosecuting
counsel. This done, I had but to let things take
their course.</p>

<p>When the day of the trial came, I was betimes
in my place at the Central Criminal Court, having
various other cases in hand there. The prisoners,
as is customary, were first put up and arraigned—that
is, had the substance of their several indictments
read over to them—and were called on to
plead ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty.’ These disposed of,
the case for John Harden was called, and I looked
at him with some curiosity. No sooner had I
done so than I knew that his was a face upon
which at some time or other I had looked before,
and of which I had taken note. It is a useful
peculiarity of mine that I never forget a face to
which I have once paid any attention, and I
can generally recollect the place and circumstances
under which I last saw it. But here
the latter part of my powers failed me. I knew
the face well, but could not imagine when and
where I had beheld it. I even knew that I had
seen the man bare-headed, and that he was not
then, as now, bald on the crown. The thing
worried me not a little. In the meanwhile, John
Harden was being put up to take his trial for the
murder of Agatha Harden.</p>

<p>‘I, m’lud, appear to prosecute in this case,’
said my counsel, starting up and down again
like the blade of a knife.</p>

<p>‘Does nobody appear for the prisoner?’ asked
the judge.</p>

<p>‘I understand, m’lud, that the prisoner is not
represented,’ said counsel, appearing and disappearing
as before.</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ said an agitated voice from the
body of the court, ‘I have used all possible
efforts’——</p>

<p>‘Si-lence!’ proclaimed the usher.</p>

<p>‘Who is that?’ inquired the judge, looking
over his spectacles.</p>

<p>‘My lord, I am this foolish fellow’s master; and
I am perfectly convinced’——</p>

<p>‘I cannot hear you, sir. If the prisoner wishes
to have counsel assigned to him for his defence,
I will name a gentleman, and will take care that
the prisoner shall have due opportunity for his
instruction; and if you desire to give evidence
on his behalf, you can do so.—Prisoner, is it your
wish that counsel be assigned to you for your
defence?’</p>

<p>Harden had been standing with his head
slightly bent, and his clasped hands resting on
the rail of the dock. He now looked up at
the judge, and replied in a grave and impassive
voice: ‘My lord, I wish no help but the help of
God. I am in His hands, and I am an innocent
man. If He sees good to deliver me, He will do
so. Who am I, that I should interfere with His
work?’</p>

<p>‘You appear to me,’ said the judge gently,
‘to be under an unfortunate delusion. You say
rightly that you are in God’s hands; but that
should not hinder you from using such instruments
for your deliverance as he offers you. Once
more I will ask, do you now desire to be represented
by counsel?’</p>

<p>‘I do not, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘So be it.—Now, Mr Clincher.’</p>

<p>Rising once more, counsel for the prosecution
proceeded to open his case. It was clear and
straightforward, put concisely and tellingly, and
embraced the facts which the reader already
knows. He then called his witnesses; and as
each after each left the box, it was easy to see
from the faces of the jury that things were likely
to go hard with the prisoner. Always, in answer
to the inquiry, ‘Do you wish to put any questions
to this witness?’ Harden replied: ‘No, my lord.
He has said the truth, for all I know.’</p>

<p>So smoothly did the trial run its course, that
only one incident called for remark. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">{233}</span>
when my client got into the box; and so
indecently eager did he appear to be to procure
the conviction of the prisoner, that he twice called
down upon himself a severe rebuke from the
judge, for persistently volunteering irrelevant
statements to Harden’s prejudice. And when
counsel at length said, ‘That, m’lud, is my
case,’ and sat down, but little doubt remained
as to the prisoner’s fate. I still sat with my
gaze fascinated by the set face in the dock, trying—trying
to remember when and where I had last
looked upon it.</p>

<p>‘Do you propose, prisoner, to call any witnesses?’
asked the judge.</p>

<p>‘Only my master, my lord—Mr Slocum. He’ll
speak for me, and he’ll say, I know, that I’m not
the man to kill any living thing.’</p>

<p>‘Very well.—And now, before calling him, do
you desire to address the jury?’</p>

<p>The interest of the case, which, except for that
interest which is inseparable from a trial for
murder, had slightly flagged, revived now that
a human being was virtually at grips with death.
For what had just passed meant that there was
no defence or attempt at a defence, that the jury
must convict, and that the man must die, without
hope of mercy for so cowardly and ungrateful a
murderer. There was not a sound in the court.
It was late in the afternoon, and the winter sun
was setting. Its rays lit up the crimson hangings,
the scarlet robes of the judge, the intent faces,
all looking one way, the drooping head and white
composed countenance of the prisoner—the man
standing up there in full health and strength,
and whose life was going down with the sun.</p>

<p>‘I have but a few words to say, my lord and
gentlemen. I didn’t do it. I was bad enough,
and maybe cruel enough in those days, to do it;
but I didn’t. I was so drunk and so mad, my
lord and gentlemen, that I might have done it
if it had happened earlier in the day, unknown
almost to myself, and be standing here rightly
enough. But I <i>know</i> I couldn’t have done it, and
why? Because I was miles away at the time.
My poor aunt, as I’ve heard from what has been
said, must have been killed between a quarter to
and a quarter past eight in the evening. Well,
at eight o’clock I was at least five miles off. If
I’d done it directly the girl went out of the
house—as she says, at a quarter to eight—it isn’t
according to reason that I could have broke open
the cupboard, took the money, and got five miles
off in a quarter of an hour.’ He stopped, and
drew the cuff of his coat across his forehead.</p>

<p>Where <i>had</i> I seen him before? Where and
when had I seen him do that very action?</p>

<p>‘O gentlemen, I couldn’t have done it! I
couldn’t, bad as I was! I know, now, how bad
that must have been—the mercy of God has been
upon me since those days—but bad as I was, I
owed her too much, and knew it, to have hurt
her in any way. Won’t you believe me? I tell
you I was miles away at the time—miles away.
Who can tell us you’re saying true? you will ask.
No one, I suppose. Not a soul was near me
that I knew, to come here and speak the truth
for me this day. But I know the same God that
saved Daniel can save me from a sorry end, if
it is His will to do it—if not, His will be done!
I’m keeping you too long, only saying the same
over and over again. I’ll just tell you how it
was, and I’ve done, and you must do as duty
bids you.’</p>

<p>Another pause. The silence of death, or rather
of a deathbed. The faces in the distance of the
darkened court shimmered through the gloom,
like those of spectres waiting to welcome a coming
shade. Then the gas-light burst forth, and all
sprang into sudden distinctness, and there was a
general half-stir as of relief.</p>

<p>‘Oh, isn’t there one here that can speak for me?
Is there any one who remembers the great gas-main
explosion in —— Street that year?’</p>

<p>There was again a stir, and a more decided one.
Clearly there were many in court who remembered
it. I did, for one. And remembering it,
I seemed as one in a tunnel, who sees the glimmer
from the distant opening, but can distinguish no
feature of the landscape beyond.</p>

<p>‘I was there—that night. It was the night of
the day I was turned out of doors—the night of
the murder. How I came to be there, so far
from my aunt’s neighbourhood, I don’t know,
but I found myself working hard, helping to lift
the stones and timber of the house-fronts that
were blown in, and getting the poor crushed
people out. I worked a long time, till I was like
to drop; and a policeman clapped me on the back
and gave me a word of praise and a drink of beer
out of a can. I wonder where that policeman is
now, and if he’d remember?’</p>

<p>He did not respond, wherever he might be.
No one to help—no friendly plank to bridge over
the yawning grave. What was it, this that I was
trying so hard to recall?</p>

<p>‘I wandered off after that into the by-streets.
I knew those parts well. I had had a comrade
who used to live there, and many a wicked and
foolish prank we’d played thereabouts. The
beer I had just drunk on an empty stomach
had muddled me again a bit, but I was quite
sober enough to know every step of the way I
went, and remember it now. I turned up
Hoadley Street, and then to the left along Blewitt
Street; and just when my aunt must have been
struggling with the wretch that took her life,
whoever it was, I heard a clock strike eight. I
did, gentlemen, and I suppose I never thought of
it since; but now I remember it as clear as day.
I was standing at the time at the corner of
Hauraki Street.’</p>

<p>It all came back to me in a moment! I heard
the patter of the rain on the cab-roof—I saw the
gleam of the infrequent lights on the wet flags—I
listened to the objurgations of the cabman at
the obstructing dray—I took note of the reflection
in the mirror, the queer street-name which would
not rhyme so as to make sense. The strokes of
the clock striking eight were in my ears. I saw
the lamp at the corner, and the man underneath
looking up at it—the man with the short broad
face, the sharp chin, the long thin mouth turned
down at the corners, and the blank in the front
teeth—the innocent man I was hounding to
his death—the prisoner at the bar!</p>

<p>As I sprang to my feet, down with a crash
went my bag full of papers, my hat and umbrella,
so that even the impassive judge gave a start,
and the usher, waking up, once more proclaimed
‘Si-lence!’ with shocked and injured inflection.
Heedless of the majesty of the law, I beckoned
to my counsel, and as he leaned over to me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">{234}</span>
surprise, I whispered earnestly in his ear. I
never saw the human face express more entire
astonishment. However, seeing that I was unmistakably
in earnest, he merely nodded and rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>‘Your lordship will pardon me,’ he said, ‘for
interfering at this stage between the prisoner and
the jury; but I am instructed to make a communication
which I feel sure will be as astounding
to your lordship and the jury as it is to
myself. I think I may say that it is the most
surprising and unprecedented thing which ever
occurred in a court of justice. My lord, the solicitor
who instructs me to prosecute tenders himself as
a witness for the defence!’</p>

</div>
<p class="ph3">BY DR ANDREW WILSON, F.R.S.E.</p>


<h3>II. FOOD AND HEALTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the point of view of the political economist,
the idle man has no right to participate in the
food-supply of the active worker. Whatever may
be the correctness and force of the arguments
which the economist may use by way of proving
that the non-worker and non-producer has no
right to participate in the ordinary nutritive
supply of his fellows, the physiological standpoint
assumes another and different aspect. The
idle man grows hungry and thirsty with the
regularity of the man who works. He demands
food and drink as does his energetic companion;
and the plea that idleness can need no food-support,
may be met in a singularly happy and
forcible fashion by a plain scientific consideration.
In the first instance, the idle man might, by an
appeal to science, show, that whilst he apparently
spent life without exertion, his bodily functions
really represented in their ordinary working an
immense amount of labour. Sleeping or waking,
that bodily pumping-engine the heart does not
fail to discharge its work, in the circulation of
the blood. The rise and fall of the chest in
the sleeping man remind us that it is not
death but his ‘twin-brother sleep,’ that we are
observing. If we make a calculation respecting
the work which the heart of a man, idle
or active, performs in twenty-four hours, we
may discover that it represents an amount of
labour equal to one hundred and twenty foot-tons.
That is to say, if we could gather all the force
expended by the heart during its work of
twenty-four hours into one huge lift, such force
would be equal to that required to raise one
hundred and twenty tons-weight one foot high.
Similarly, the work of the muscles of breathing
in twenty-four hours, represents a force equal to
that required to lift twenty-one tons one foot
high. These are only two examples out of many,
which the ordinary work and labour of mere
vegetative existence, without taking into consideration
any work performed—in the popular
sense of the term—involves.</p>

<p>We thus discover that, apart altogether from
the every-day labour of life, in which brain and
muscles engage, an immense amount of work is
performed in the mere act of keeping ourselves
alive. Nowhere in nature is work performed
without proportionate waste, or wear and tear
of the machine that works. This dictum holds
quite as true of the human body as of the steam-engine.
And as the engine or other machine
requires to be supplied with the conditions necessary
for the production of force, so the living
body similarly demands a supply of material
from which its energy (or the power of doing
work) can be derived. As the engine obtains the
necessary conditions from the fuel and water it
consumes, so the living body derives its energy
from the food upon which it subsists. Food
in this light is therefore merely matter taken
from the outside world, and from which our
bodies derive the substances required for the
repair of the waste which the continual work of
life entails. In the young, food serves a double
purpose—it supplies material for growth, and it
also affords substance from which the supply of
force is derived. In the adult, whilst no doubt,
to a certain extent, the food supplies actual loss
of substance, it is more especially devoted to the
performance of work, and of maintaining that
equilibrium or balance between work and repair,
which, as we have seen, constitutes health.</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, the first important rule
for food-taking is founded on the plain fact, that
in the food we must find the substances necessary
for the repair of our bodies, and for the
production of the energy through which work
is performed. Food-substances in this light
fall into two well-marked classes—namely, into
<i>Nitrogenous</i> and <i>Non-nitrogenous</i> substances. Another
classification of foods divides them into
<i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i>, the former being derived
from animals and plants—that is, from living
beings—while the latter are derived from the world
of non-living matter. Thus, animal and plant substances
represent organic foods; while water and
minerals, both of which are absolutely essential
for the support of the body, represent inorganic
food materials. It would appear that from
living matter alone, do we obtain the materials
for generating force. The inorganic water and
minerals, however, appear to be absolutely necessary
for the chemical alterations and changes
which are continually taking place within the
body.</p>

<p>Adopting the classification of foods into the
<i>Nitrogenous</i> and <i>Non-nitrogenous</i> groups, we discover
examples of the first class in such substances
as <i>albumen</i>, seen familiarly in white of
egg and other substances; <i>gluten</i>, found in flour;
<i>gelatin</i>, obtained from hoofs and horns; <i>legumin</i>,
obtained from certain vegetables; <i>casein</i>, found
in milk; and allied chemical substances. These
substances possess a remarkable similarity or uniformity
of composition. It would appear that
in the process of digestion they are reduced to
a nearly similar state, and on this account they
can replace one another to a certain extent in the
dietaries of mankind.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous foods have often been popularly
termed ‘flesh-formers,’ and doubtless this name is
well merited. For, as the result of experiment,
it would seem that the chief duty performed by
the nitrogenous parts of our food is that of
building up and repairing the tissues of the
body. They also produce heat, through being
chemically changed in the blood, and thus aid
in the production of force or energy. But it
would also appear tolerably certain, that in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">{235}</span>
complex fashion the nitrogenous parts of our
bodies assist or regulate in a very exact manner
the oxidation or chemical combustion of the
tissues.</p>

<p>It should be noted that nitrogenous foods
are composed chemically of the four elements,
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen; the
presence of the last element giving the characteristic
name and chemical features to the group.
Most of these foods in addition contain small proportions
of sulphur and phosphorus.</p>

<p>An interesting advance in our knowledge of
the part played by nitrogenous foods in the work
of the body was made, when an idea of Liebig
was overthrown by later experimentation. Liebig
supposed that the nitrogenous foods required first
to be actually converted into tissue—that is, into
bodily substance—before their energy or work-producing
power could be liberated. In this view,
muscular force, through which we move, was
believed to be dependent on the changes, destructive
or otherwise, which take place in the muscles.
The substance called <i>urea</i>, chiefly given off as a
waste product by the kidneys and chemically
representing nitrogenous waste, was in Liebig’s
view regarded as representing the results of muscular
force which had been exerted. But two
scientists, Fick and Wislicenus of Zurich, proved,
by a laborious series of personal experiments in
mountain ascents, that a non-nitrogenous diet will
maintain the body for a short time during the
performance of severe work, no great increase in
the amount of urea given off being noticed.
The work in question was proved to have been
performed on the carbon and hydrogen of the
food consumed. These experiments have led to
the now accepted view, that a muscle, instead of
losing substance during work and thus wasting,
in reality consumes nitrogen, and grows. The
exhaustion of the muscle is dependent not so
much on chemical waste, as on the accumulation
within it of the waste products of other foods.
The muscle, in other words, is merely the agent
whereby so much energy, derived from the food,
is converted into actual and applied force. Did
muscle really waste, as Liebig supposed, the heart’s
substance would be entirely consumed by its
work of one week!</p>

<p>Such being the functions and nature of nitrogenous
foods, we may now glance at the non-nitrogenous
division. Four groups of foods are
included in this latter class—namely (1) Starches
and sugars, or ‘amyloids’ as they are often termed;
(2) fats and oils; (3) minerals; (4) water. The
<i>starches and sugars</i> include not merely starch
and sugar, as ordinarily known, but various gums,
and certain acids, such as lactic and acetic acids.
Starch, as in bread, is a most important food.
These foods appear to go directly to maintain
animal heat, and to give energy, or the power
of doing work, to the animal frame. The heat-producing
powers of starches and sugars are
certainly inferior to those of the fats and oils.
But starches and sugars can be converted into
fat within the system; and hence persons who
suffer from a tendency to obesity are warned to
exclude these foods from their dietaries. Starches
and sugars likewise appear to assist in some
measure the digestion of nitrogenous foods. That
<i>fats and oils</i> are heat-producing foods is a fact
taught us by the common experience of mankind
that northern nations consume the greatest proportion
of fat. The heat-producing powers of
fat have been set down at two and a half times
as great as those of starch and sugar; and there
is no doubt that, in addition to assisting in the
conversion of food into body substances, the fatty
parts of our food also assist in the work of
removing waste matters from the body. Fat, in
addition, being chemically burned in the blood,
gives rise to the force which we exert in ordinary
muscular work.</p>

<p>The <i>mineral</i> parts of our food play an important
part in the maintenance of the frame. We thus
require iron for the blood, phosphorus for the
brain and nerves, and lime for the bones; whilst
a variety of other minerals is likewise found in
the blood and other fluids of the frame. The
uses of the mineral constituents of our body are
still a matter of speculation. Small as may
be the quantity of certain minerals required
for the support of the body, serious health-derangement
may result when we are deprived of
these substances. Thus, scurvy appears to be
a disease associated with the want of the mineral
potash in the blood; and the cure of this disease
is therefore accomplished when we supply to
the blood those mineral elements which have
previously been deficient. Common salt, or
chloride of sodium, as it is chemically termed,
although not entering into the composition of
the body, appears to form an important part of
all the secretions; and there can be little doubt
that this mineral aids the formation and chemical
integrity of the gastric juice of the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Water</i> forms the last item in the list of non-nitrogenous
foods. Of all foods, perhaps, water
is the most important, seeing that it is a substance
which, in the absence of all other nourishment,
can sustain life for a period numbering
many days. Thus, whilst a man dies in from
six to seven days when deprived of solid food
and water, life may be prolonged to as many as
sixty days on water alone. The high importance
of water as a food is abundantly proved,
when we discover that it constitutes about
two-thirds of the weight of the body; that it
enters into the composition of the brain to the
extent of eighty per cent.; that the blood consists
of nearly eighty per cent. of water; and
that even bone contains ten per cent. of this
fluid. Entering thus into the composition of
every fluid and tissue of the body, and being
perpetually given off from lungs, skin, and
kidneys in the ordinary work of life, there
is little wonder that water assumes the first
place amongst foods. Regarding the uses of
water as a food, we see that it dissolves and
conveys other foods throughout the system; that
it assists in removing waste products; and that
it also takes a share in regulating the temperature
of the body through its evaporation on the
skin.</p>

<p>Having thus considered the chemistry of foods,
we may now pass to discuss the natural rules
which science describes for the health-regulation
of life in the matter of diet. A primary rule
for food-taking is that which shows that, for the
due support of the body, we require a combination
of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous foods.
This fact is proved by the consideration that
milk, ‘nature’s own food,’ on which the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">{236}</span>
being grows rapidly in early life, is a compound
of both classes of foods. So also, in an
egg, from which is formed an animal body,
we find a combination of the two classes. Death
results if we attempt to feed on either class
alone; and as the body consists of both classes of
substances, the justification for the combination of
foods is complete. Man can obtain the required
combination of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous
foods from animals alone, from vegetables alone,
or from animals and vegetables combined. The
water, of course, which is an absolutely essential
feature of all dietaries, is regarded as an additional
item. In regulating the dietary of mankind, it
is found that the food of nations is determined
largely, or completely, by their situation on the
earth’s surface. Thus, the northern nations are
largely animal feeders; whilst the southern peoples
of the world are to a great extent vegetarians.
Individual experience and taste produce amongst
the units of a nation special proclivities in the
way of diet. But we can readily see that mankind,
with that elasticity of constitution and
power to avail themselves of their surroundings,
can adapt themselves to their environments,
and become animal feeders, vegetable feeders, or
subsist on a mixed dietary at will. This is the
true solution of the vegetarian controversy. It
is climate and race which determine the food of
a nation. It is individual intelligence, liking,
and constitution which determine variations and
departures from the dietaries of the race.</p>

<p>The relations between food and work naturally
present themselves as topics of the highest importance.
In determining the standard of health, it
is clear that from our food alone, we can obtain
the energy or power of work required for the
discharge of the duties of life. An interesting
point therefore arises regarding the differences
which are entailed by varying conditions and
amounts of labour. Dr Letheby tells us that an
adult man in <i>idleness</i> requires, to obtain from
his food for the support of his body, 2.67 ounces
of nitrogenous matter and 19.16 ounces of non-nitrogenous
matter per day. If the individual is
to participate in <i>ordinary labour</i>, the amount of
nitrogenous matter obtained from his food must be
increased to 4.56 ounces, while the non-nitrogenous
must be represented by 29.24 ounces. In the
case, lastly, of <i>active labour</i> the amount of food
required must be increased to 5.81 ounces of
nitrogenous, and 34.97 ounces of non-nitrogenous
matter.</p>

<p>Dalton gives the following as the quantity of
food, per day, required for the healthy man, taking
free exercise in the open air: meat, sixteen ounces;
bread, nineteen ounces; fat or butter, three and a
half ounces; water, fifty-two fluid ounces. It
ought to be borne in mind that these amounts
of food represent the diet for a whole day compressed,
so to speak, into a convenient and
readily understood form. Another calculation,
setting down the daily amount of food required
by an adult, at nitrogenous matter three hundred
grains, and carbon at four thousand grains, shows
that these amounts would be obtained from
eighteen ounces of bread; one ounce of butter;
four ounces of milk; two ounces of bacon; eight
ounces of potatoes; six ounces of cabbage; three
and a half ounces of cheese; one ounce of sugar;
three-quarters of an ounce of salt; and water
(alone, and in beverages) sixty-six and a quarter
ounces—a total of no less than six pounds fourteen
and a quarter ounces. Summing up the question
of the amounts of food required by a healthy adult
daily, and <i>excluding water in all forms as a matter
of separate calculation</i>, it may be said that four
and a half ounces of pure nitrogenous matter
would be required in addition to three ounces
of fatty food, fourteen ounces of starch or sugar,
and one ounce of mineral matter. An ordinary
adult consuming in twenty-four hours, food items
equal to those contained in one pound of meat
and two pounds of bread, may be regarded as
consuming food of sufficient amount for ordinary
work. When the work is increased, the diet must
naturally be increased likewise. We find that
persons in active employment require about a
fifth part more nitrogenous food, and about twice
the quantity of fat consumed by those engaged
in light work; the sugars and starches remaining
the same.</p>

<p>An interesting practical calculation has been
made regarding the amounts of different foods
required to perform a given and fixed piece of
work. Taking the work performed by the
German observers already named, as a standard,
namely, that of raising a man’s weight (one hundred
and forty pounds) ten thousand feet high,
it has been found that the amounts and cost of
various foods required for the performance of
this work is as follows: Bread, 2.345 pounds, cost
3½d.; oatmeal, 1.281 pounds, cost 3½d.; potatoes,
5.068 pounds, cost 5¼d.; beef-fat, 0.555 pounds, cost
5¼d.; cheese, 1.156 pounds, cost 11½d.; butter, 0.693
pounds, cost 1s. 0½d.; lean beef, 3.532 pounds, cost 3s. 6½d.;
pale ale, nine bottles, cost 4s. 6d.</p>

<p>The proportion of the different food-elements
in an ordinary dietary has been set down as
follows: nitrogenous matter one, fats six, starches
and sugars three; and these proportions appear
to be represented with singular exactness in the
ordinary dietaries which experience has recommended
to mankind. Excess of food in the
matter of nitrogenous elements tends to induce
diseases of an inflammatory and gouty nature, and
likewise leads to fatty degeneration of the tissues.
When, on the other hand, there exists lack of
nitrogenous substances, the individual experiences
weakness, want of muscular power, and general
prostration. The healthy mean is that in which
the proportions of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous
food are maintained as above indicated.</p>

<p>In the construction of dietaries, a few practical
hints remain for notice. Thus, as regards sex, the
dietaries of women are usually, in the case of the
working-classes, estimated at one-tenth less than
those of the opposite sex. Age has an important
influence in determining the amount and quality
of food. The growing body consumes more food,
relatively to work and weight, than the adult,
inasmuch as it requires material for new tissue.
An infant under eight or nine months should
receive no starch whatever in its dietary, because
it is unable to digest that substance. Health is
naturally a condition in which the question of
foods assumes a high importance, and various
dietaries, as is well known, are adapted for the
cure of disease. The relation of food to work
has already been alluded to, and statistics detailed;
but it may be added that the brain-worker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">{237}</span>
requires his food in a more readily digestible
form, and also in smaller bulk and in more
concentrated shape, than the muscle-worker or
ordinary labourer. What has been said concerning
foods will tend to show how wide is the field
which the subject of nutrition occupies. It may
only here be added, that the education of the
individual in health laws and in the science of
foods and food-taking, forms the only sure basis
for the intelligent regulation of that all-important
work—the nourishment and due support of the
frame in relation to the work we perform and to
every circumstance of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COMMON-SENSE_OF_SUPERSTITIONS">THE COMMON-SENSE OF SUPERSTITIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> of a medley of magpies, May cats, broken
looking-glasses, crickets, village cures, lucky days,
and tumbles up-stairs, there dawns a hint towards
the solving of a very puzzling problem. The
problem is, not why these things are called lucky
or unlucky, but how it is that multitudes grow
up in every generation to believe the same absurdities,
and that still in this world of common-sense
such items of uncommon nonsense keep
their character for ‘coming true.’ How is this,
and where do the secret links exist between the
sense and the nonsense? If any one takes the
trouble to gather together about a hundred rustic
superstitions and old beliefs of quackery, the
reason of the character for ‘coming true’—that
is, the reason of the traditional hold upon the
people—will presently begin to be plainly written
across the whole medley, dawning by degrees,
just as writing in acid might dawn upon an
apparently blank missive held to the heat.</p>

<p>Most superstitions are signs of ill-luck. This
in itself is a tell-tale fact. Unlucky omens are
so numerous, that no believer could escape them
for long; and in all likelihood he observes not
only the unlucky signs, but his ill-luck following.
The truth is, that the magpie on his path had no
connection with his loss of money; and on his
wedding-day, his bride’s unlucky glance in the
looking-glass after she was fully arrayed, had
nothing to do with her discontent as a wife; nor
need the servant who broke the looking-glass
have cried, looking forward to seven years of
ill-luck. In all three cases, as all the neighbours
knew, the ill-luck came. But it came because
of the prepossessed frame of mind that observed
and discounted these signs. The superstitious
character lacks those practical and courageous
qualities which wrest luck from fortune and make
the best of life. The omens of ill-luck have come
to the fortunate as often; but they were never
noticed, because they who were cheerily fighting
the battle had better use for their time. At
this moment, the present writer knows of no
household more radiantly prosperous than one
in which the largest looking-glass was broken a
few days after a move to their newly-built home;
and no marriage more replete with happiness than
a Saturday marriage, though proverbially Saturday’s
marriage ‘has no luck at all.’ Of course,
neither the prosperous household nor the well-matched
pair were of that languid and timid mind
that takes nervous note of superstitions.</p>

<p>But, it may be objected, there are signs of good
luck too, though not so many. Certainly; and
there is no truth better known than that courage
commands success, and such courage in exceptional
cases may come from a very trivial encouragement.
There is a country superstition that if a
man sets off running and runs round in a circle,
when he hears the cuckoo for the first time, he
will never be out of work till spring comes
again. But the man who valued steady work
would exert himself in a more sensible direction
than unproductive circle-running, and be safe
from idle days. Again, if a tumble up-stairs is
lucky, the predisposition to luck is in the person
who will be active and quick enough to run up
the staircase. Another good omen, the turning
of a garment inside out in dressing, though it
seems to tell of the slovenliness that will not
succeed, has probably an origin that indicated
something better; it is a country saying, and
it might well refer to the hurry and awkwardness
of rising without artificial light before day—a
habit likely to help the farmer’s household to good
fortune. Or as proof of the real nature of many
good signs which time has perverted into superstitions,
can we doubt that the crickets which
chirp round the hearth for luck were first noticed
there because crickets, as a rule, only come to a
warm and cosy fireside—the kind of hearth that
marks a happy cottage home?</p>

<p>A simple grain of common-sense like this
must have been the origin of many senseless
observances. It was necessary to guard ladders
from being knocked down, so superstition began
to warn the passers-by: if the children went
under the ladder, they would not grow; if girls
went, they would have no chance of being married
within the year; and if a man passed under, he
would be hanged—in memory of the criminal’s
ladder under the gibbet.</p>

<p>To take another original grain of common-sense.
Warnings against carelessness assumed the form
of omens. To spill the salt was unfortunate;
or in some country places, to spill new milk;
or in parts of Southern Europe, to spill the oil.
Leonardo da Vinci painted spilt salt near Judas
in his famous ‘Last Supper.’ It is one of the
most widespread of ill omens, though in different
places there are shades of difference; for instance,
in Holland it betokens a shipwreck.</p>

<p>Beside the superstitious disposition being what
we may call an unlucky disposition, and beside
the germ of encouragement that makes its own
success out of some ‘good signs,’ and the atom of
original prudence that still exists in some so-called
bad omens, there are two other reasons why
superstitions still keep hold of the people by a
reputation for ‘coming true.’ These two reasons
cover a great deal of ground in our theory of
explanation. The first is the vague character of
forecasts. For instance, we all know the rhymes
about the luck of birthdays, which country-people
of different shires repeat rather variously. One
Scottish version is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Monday’s bairn is fair of face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tuesday’s bairn is full of grace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wednesday’s bairn is a child of woe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thursday’s bairn has far to go;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">{238}</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Friday’s bairn is loving and giving;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saturday’s bairn works hard for a living;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the bairn that is born on the Sabbath day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is lively and bonnie, and wise and gay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Contrast with this the English version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Monday, fair in face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Tuesday, full of God’s grace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Wednesday, merry and glad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Thursday, sour and sad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Friday, godly given;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Saturday, work for your living;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born of a Sunday, never shall we want—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So there ends the week, and there’s an end on’t.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Any superstitious rustic who, from the page of
the cottage Bible, dug out the deep secret of the
day of his birth, would easily find the rhyme
true of himself for any day of the week. Any
country girl would trust it was true, if she
was born on a Monday. And who that came
on a Tuesday would confess himself graceless?
But about Wednesday’s bairn there seems to be
a difference of opinion among the prophets:
one rhyme predicts ‘a child of woe;’ the other
says, ‘merry and glad;’ while a third, well
known in Devonshire, says, ‘sour and grum;’
and thereby, from self-contradiction, the old
rhyme goes down like a house of cards. But
all the rhymsters are agreed that Saturday’s
child works hard for his living—as no doubt
the children of every other day of the week work
too, in the sphere of labouring country-life in
which these old sayings are known. And as
variable as this forecast there are many others;
for every firm believer in superstition has a secret
satisfaction in proving it true; and which of us
is there that could not read our life as the interpretation
of any forecast, since we all can look
at the bright or the dark side, having known alike
the good and the evil days?</p>

<p>The other reason for the reputation for truth
is, that, for credulous folk, unlucky omens are
too terrible to be put to the test. If they
were freely tried, they would be detected as a
mental tyranny, a popular fraud; and in a few
generations would be remembered by the rustic
classes, only as the learned now remember the
foolish excitement of their forefathers in science,
seeking the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher’s
Stone. If dinner-parties of thirteen were to
become the fashion, we should not see, as we
often see now, the cautious arrangements of
Christmas invitations, or even the timid compromise
of bringing in a side-table to accommodate
the thirteenth. But which of the credulous
would dare to test these things? It reminds the
writer of a doubt—still unsolved—whether the
taste of parsley would cause a parrot to drop
down dead. Parsley as a parrot-poison was heard
of in childhood, not as a superstition, but as a
physical fact. What if it were true? The <i>if</i> was
too terrible. We had visions of our feathered
gray ‘Prince Charlie’ seizing the green stuff in
his hooked beak, and rolling off the perch in
mortal agonies. So we disbelieved, but coward-like
avoided the chance, just as all the world
avoids thirteen at table.</p>

<p>As to superstitious cures, some of them contain
slight elements of medicinal value; but most
depend upon that influence upon the nerves
which is well known to be capable of giving
energy for a time and allaying pain. Some of
the old cures were decidedly disagreeable and
troublesome. The native of Devonshire who
wanted to get rid of a wart was solemnly enjoined
to steal a piece of meat, and after rubbing the
wart with it, throw it over his left shoulder over
a wall. The Hertfordshire villager, when afflicted
with ague, might be cured if he would go to
Berkhampstead, where oak-trees grew at the cross-roads;
and after pegging himself by a lock of
hair to the trunk of one of these trees, he was
to give a vigorous jump, and rid himself at once
of the ague and the tuft of hair. The loss of the
hair was so painful, and the loss of the ague so
doubtful, that the Berkhampstead folks many
years ago ceased to go to ‘the cross-oaks.’ The
ague, the toothache, and dog-bites were the
subject of many charms. In the former two
maladies, a nervous impression might go far to
cure; and in the last, a charm against hydrophobia
would protect the simple believer from
the great peril that is in a brooding fear of
madness. The ludicrous cures were a legion in
themselves. It seems heartlessly unkind to give
a poor dog the measles; but many an old nurse
took a lock of hair from the nape of the sick
child’s neck, made a sort of sandwich of it between
bread-and-butter, and watched at the door to
transfer, or fancy she had transferred, the measles
to a stray dog—probably a stray dog, because
only an ill-fed animal would take her bread.
Equally unkind was it to strive to give our dumb
friend the whooping-cough; but by the same
process, with a bunch of hair and a piece of
meat, the nurse could be guilty of that absurdity
as well.</p>

<p>Have any of our readers ever encountered
a toad with the whooping-cough? The Cheshire
toads ought to be sometimes found crowing and
whooping and in need of change of air; for
the superstitious Cheshire woman whose child
has the cough, knows that she has only to
poke a toad’s head into her child’s mouth to
transfer the whooping-cough to the toad. Query,
Is the disease also transferred—and in that case,
what are the alarming results—when the victim
of whooping-cough gets rid of it by being passed
nine times under and over a donkey? The cure
for rickets is to pass the child under and over
the donkey nine-times-nine turns. This was
actually done in London as late as 1845; when
a man and a woman, solemnly counting, passed
the unfortunate child under and over the unsuspecting
moke eighty-one times, in the midst of an
admiring crowd. If there was one pass more
or less, the charm would fail—a broad enough
hint of the excuses that could be made when
such cures as these were sought in vain. The
eighty-one turns must have confused the counters’
arithmetic, as no doubt the child had personal
objections, and lifted its voice aloud; and sore
must have been the trial even to the patience
of a donkey.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, we would suggest that superstitions
keep their false character for truth, firstly,
because those who observe them therein prove
their own leaning towards ill-luck; secondly,
because forecasts are vague, and interpretations
can be traced somehow in the chances of life;
thirdly, because the penalty of ill omens is so
dreaded, that the credulous shrink from putting
them to the test; fourthly, because there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">{239}</span>
nervous cures, and love-charms, and dreams, in
which anxious consciousness points right—the
wish being father to the thought; fifthly, victims
of superstition are secretly pleased when (by
chance) an unlucky omen comes true, and have
a satisfaction even in relating their misfortunes;
while, since no one tells of the cases
that do <i>not</i> come true, every chance fulfilment
is a new rivet in the chain that ought long ago
to have fallen to pieces.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOXIOUS_MANUFACTURES">NOXIOUS MANUFACTURES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is just now a most wholesome activity
in regard to the national health, and the public
are peculiarly interested in the various details
of our sanitary machinery. Of this, by no
means the least important department is that
instituted under the Alkali Works Regulation
Act, 1881, or, in other words, the inspection of
noxious works and factories. In connection with
the pollution of rivers, this is an old grievance;
but too little has hitherto been done to realise or
to remedy the evil in its general effects upon the
public health. So greatly, too, have works prejudicial
to health increased of late years, that
their inspection has been decided upon none too
soon. Probably, it will never be known how
far the death-rate has been influenced by this
cause. It is, however, one of the unavoidable
penalties of civilisation that we should live under
unwholesome conditions of life.</p>

<p>A multitude of influences injurious to health
spring into active existence with the development
of commerce and the growth of luxury.
Most of these are evident enough. All the
elements, indeed, are equally guilty. The earth,
air, fire, and water, are allied against civilised
humanity; and modern science is constantly
bringing to light disagreeable facts in this connection.
We have long lived in the comfortable
belief that Mother Earth was the great purifier.
The reverse is, it seems, nearer the truth. Years
after the germs of infection have been consigned
to the ground, they have been disinterred, and
found to be not a whit diminished in virulence.
Archæologists should, we are told, beware of
handling newly found relics, lest, perchance, they
should contract some archaic disease. Even
mummies, it appears, in spite of their venerable
respectability, are objects of legitimate suspicion!
Fire, too, has a dreary catalogue of sins to answer
for. It not only robs us of much of the oxygen,
of which those of us who live in the towns have
so scanty a supply, but it gives us in exchange
unconsumed carbon in quantities which fill the
air with smut. In smoke alone it furnishes us
with food for reflection—and digestion—and
probably will continue to do so for some time to
come.</p>

<p>Again, water is the most insidious enemy of
all. The most indispensable of the elements—and
we are reminded of our obligations to it
pretty frequently—it is credited with doing the
greatest harm. In league with unnatural substances,
it has developed such an affinity for
noxious matter that it appears that nothing short
of boiling can possibly enable us to drink it with
any security. To most people, cold boiled water
will not seem a very attractive beverage, but it
has the advantage of being in many ways a safe
one.</p>

<p>The air, too, is anything but true to the trust
committed to her charge. We have long confidingly
believed in her good-will. Our sewers,
drains, and chimneys discharge their pestilent
exhalations into the air; but instead of carrying
these away into space, she receives them only to
bestow them upon us again.</p>

<p>The outlook is indeed gloomy, and unless we
make some progress in sanitary science, it is not
a little difficult to see how we are to continue to
support the burden of civilised existence.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is reassuring to know that
something is being done to lessen these ominously
numerous artificial dangers. The works which
come within the scope of the Alkali, &amp;c. Works
Act, 1881, are very injurious to life. The manufacture
of alkalies, acids, chemical manures, salt,
and cement, alike involve processes prejudicial
to health. More than one thousand of these were
visited by the inspectors, appointed in pursuance
of the above Act, during the year 1882; and it is
interesting to know that some intelligent means
are being devised whereby the offensive character
of these manufactures may be diminished. To
take a single cause of mischief. The manufacture
of alkalies and acids has long been conducted in
such a way that the proportion of noxious matter
which was allowed to escape into the chimney,
or atmosphere, often reached from twenty to
forty grains per cubic foot of air, twenty being a
not uncommon amount. The maximum amount
which might be allowed to escape with impunity
has been estimated at four grains per cubic foot;
and it is a very important feature of the Act
that it has been instrumental in reducing this
very considerably. In the alkali works proper
the escape has been brought down to two grains,
while in some cases it is under one. The
sulphuric acid works alone are now conspicuous
for their failings in this important respect, the
average escape in those examined during the
year being 5.5. Again, chemical manure-works
have long been a pregnant source of annoyance
to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood in which
these are carried on.</p>

<p>It is, curiously enough, the smaller establishments
of the kind which are the most harmful.
The larger works have long employed the most
complete processes, because the escape of effluvia
would otherwise have been so great, that it
would have speedily aroused hostile action on the
part of the public. The imposition of preventive
measures in the case of the smaller works—in
many of which no precautions whatever have
hitherto been adopted—is attended with some
difficulty, since it involves an expenditure which
would in some cases be almost prohibitive. It
appears, indeed, that no maximum of escape can
be fixed in works of this kind, and all that remains
to be done is to render it compulsory that processes
should be adopted for washing out such gases
as are soluble, and for burning those which are
more susceptible to such a method of treatment.
Since such pernicious agents as fluorine compounds
escape during the action of sulphuric acid upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">{240}</span>
phosphates, the question is one of some urgency.
Again, another cause of complaint is the escape
of sulphuretted hydrogen during the process of
making sulphate of ammonia. In the larger gas-liquor-works
the gas is burned, and converted
into sulphuric acid in lead chambers; while in
others it is passed through oxide of iron; and both
these methods are perfectly satisfactory when
properly carried out. Again, the discharge of
sulphurous or muriatic gases evolved in extracting
salt from brine is an evil which has remained
unremedied almost down to the present time.
Not the least curious feature of this question, too,
is the fact that many of the products of distillation
are so valuable that it is more than mere neglect
to throw them away in the form of noxious gases.
It is unnecessary to describe here the state of the
salt districts. They might serve as a type of the
abomination of desolation. The combined effect
of the gases and the soot, which pours forth in
prodigious volumes and from the chimneys of
nearly a hundred salt-works in Cheshire alone,
is most deplorable.</p>

<p>The only possible conclusion from this Report
is that we are still far behindhand in these
matters. We have, for instance, long continued
to burn coal on the same principle, and are
very slow to believe in any of the new methods
which have been and are continually being
introduced. Yet not only is black smoke very
much more injurious to animal and vegetable
life than when it has been rendered colourless
by burning, but it is peculiarly wasteful. It
has long been known that many valuable commodities
could be obtained from coal; and but
too little progress has hitherto been made in this
direction. It is, then, all the more interesting
to know that in some works in the north of
England the gases from the blast furnaces have
been cooled and washed, and ammoniacal salts
obtained in such quantities as to make the process
economical; while by the ‘Young and Beilby’
process it is contended that not only can the fuel
be consumed for nothing, but that there will be
several shillings a ton profit.</p>

<p>So far as manufactures are concerned, there
certainly seems to be no valid reason why the
rule that they must consume their own smoke
should not be much more freely enforced. In
the case of the alkali trades, which have long been
in a very bad state, it is, of course, an unfortunate
time to suggest the necessity for the outlay of
more capital in improved works. But the exigencies
of the public health are paramount, and
needlessly offensive processes cannot be tolerated
much longer. Such a case as that reported from
Widnes, where waste heaps of offensive matter,
consisting chiefly of sulphur and lime, are allowed
to accumulate, although the sulphur could be
extracted at a profit, and so prevented from
poisoning the streams for miles around, is certainly
difficult to explain. The drainage from these
heaps alone is estimated as carrying away twelve
tons or seventy pounds-worth of sulphur a day.
But perhaps as soon as some satisfactory system
for eliminating the sulphur has been hit upon,
this will be remedied. We have certainly much
yet to learn in sanitary science. The old theories
are one by one being exploded, and it will no
longer do for us to poison the air we breathe,
under the pleasing impression that its purifying
properties are inexhaustible. Civilisation has
made such strides that she has succeeded in overturning
the equilibrium of nature. The equilibrium
must be restored.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRIMMING_THE_FEET_OF_ELEPHANTS">TRIMMING THE FEET OF ELEPHANTS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The feet of elephants kept for show purposes are
trimmed two or three times a year. The sole of
an elephant’s foot is heavily covered with a thick
horny substance of material similar to the three
toe-nails on each foot; and as it grows thicker
and thicker, it tends to contract and crack, often
laming the animal. Barnum the American showman
recently subjected his elephants to the
trimming process at one of the towns where he
was exhibiting. With a knife about two feet
long, great pieces of horn, six inches by four, and
a quarter of an inch thick, were shaved off.
Often pieces of glass, wire, nails, and other things
are found imbedded in the foot, which have been
picked up during street parades. Sometimes
these irritating morsels work up into the leg and
produce a festering sore. A large nail was found
imbedded in the foot of one of the elephants,
which had to be extracted with a pair of pincers,
and the wound syringed with warm water.
During the operation, the huge creature appeared
to suffer great pain, but seemed to know that
it would afterwards obtain relief, and therefore
bore it patiently, and trumpeted its pleasure at
the close. Three times around an elephant’s
front-hoof is said to be his exact height.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
